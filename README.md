# 🥖 Pain Control App

An inventory management tool designed specifically for a bakery looking to streamline its daily stock and baking tasks. Previously, the bakery staff manually tracked and calculated bread inventory and baking needs—a process that was time-consuming and prone to error. This application was developed to automate and optimize this daily task, allowing staff to efficiently manage stock levels and ensure the right amount of fresh bread is always available.
